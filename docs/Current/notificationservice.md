 # Notification Service

**Status**: [**Assess**|Trial|Adopt|Hold]

## Description
A service offering an interface to send short messages, with optionally one action(link), that should be sent* to either a single user or a group of users.

The service should support multiple delivery channels as well as the ability for an end user to view all their notifications some place, ideally in the BCC Topbar

### Context
BCC Forbundet wants to notify users of specific groups that a new article was published

BCC Event wants to notify a user when they are registered or unregistered from an event or activity

### Background
Instead of each service implementing their own notification service, we would like to consolidate the effort a nd make a simple to use service

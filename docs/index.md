## Introduction

The purpose of *decision records* is both to document organisation-wide decisions and to provide a process for making these decisions.

By following a process that encourages input from multiple participants we can both improve the quality of decisions made - and commit to these decisions.

A commitment to using the same technologies, processes, tools etc. can have a positive impact on productivity, security and knowledge sharing accross teams.

title: Decision Records for BCC IT
home: true

## Introduction

The purpose of *decision records* is both to document organisation-wide decisions and to provide a process for making these decisions.

By following a process that encourages input from multiple participants we can both improve the quality of decisions made - and commit to these decisions.

A commitment to using the same technologies, processes, tools etc. can have a positive impact on productivity, security and knowledge sharing accross teams.

### ⭐ Decision Criteria

::: info
In general, decisions should be optimised to allow us to deliver services securely and efficiently - they should result in saved time without compromising security.
:::

The risk/benefits associated with the points below should be evaluated:

🔒 **Security**: data protection  
How will alternatives impact ability to ensure and maintain data *access control* and *integrity*?

🚀 **Delivering Value**: quality/speed  
How will alternatives impact ability to deliver *reliable* services/applications *quickly*?

♻ **Sustainability**: optimize cost and risk  
How will alternatives impact long term operational costs and (in)dependence on an individual's know-how?

### Decision Process

Decisions can be made following the process below. After each step, request feedback from potential stakeholders!

#### Roles

**Initiator**: person/team who would like a decision made. This can be __anyone__!  
**Decision Board**: IT Manager + BCC Media Tech Lead + Initiator

#### Process

✔ **Define**: decision, criteria and context *(anyone)*  
✔ **Investigate**: find alternatives *(initiator)*
✔ **Assess**: based on criteria *(initiator + decision board)*  
✔ **Trial**: try in practice *(initiator)*

::: tip

1. The process is started by creating a new *markdown* file defining the decision to be made.

2. The markdown file is updated as the prosess progresses.  

3. Changes can be submitted as a **pull-request** that potential stakeholders are asked to review.
